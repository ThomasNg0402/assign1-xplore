Asean X'Plore
The website is called ASEAN X'Plore. It contains 4 accessible pages in total, Home page, Countries page, Attractions page and faq page. It is an educational page that contains facts and information about the world. The content mainly revolves around ASEAN countries.

Design Process
ASEAN X'Plore is a website built with the main purpose of promoting ASEAN countries to the world, mostly foreigners and potential tourists. It also aims to enlighten the users to recognize the country by its flag and learn the name and where it is located. This is achieved by leading them into a short journey where users browse through page by page. As a user type, I want to be able to learn things in a fun, interesting and not so tedious way, so that I am able to absorb the information more effectively. As a user type, I want to direct to the intended page while being told to, so I can see the content.

Features
Every page contains a menu which user can direct between pages. It also contains a search bar which user can use. In addition, there is a footer section in every page as well which user can know more details about the page, verify the page and follow social media pages. There is also another search bar where user inputs their email for submission.
The home page welcomes the user to the webpage with a text message, introduces what ASEAN is and directs user to the countries page.
The countries page contains a hover effect where the user can see a short description of the country when hovering over the area surrounding the flag. There is also a button to direct user to the attractions page.
The attractions page have multiple features, 
one of them is when user hovers over the flag,a embed interactive google maps section will shows the location of which the country is located. In addition, user can see a transition betwwen a photo to another photo or youtube video when the pictures under the attraction segment is hovered. There is also a "try it" button that user can click on to see which country the attractions are located at. Lastly there is a call to action button to the faq page.
The faq page have a search bar for user to search what text they are looking for.
